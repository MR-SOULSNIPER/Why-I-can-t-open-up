<h3>Page 1</h3>
<p>
Hey Angel… I’m really sorry. I know sometimes I seem quiet or distant, and I know that can be confusing. 
The truth is, I struggle to speak about how I truly feel. Every time I try to open up, it feels like my emotions become too heavy for people. 
I start overthinking every word, wondering if I am saying too much or not enough. 
Sometimes it feels easier to stay silent than to risk being misunderstood.

<div class="page" id="p2" style="z-index:3;">
<h3>Page 2</h3>
<p>
I was always told to keep my feelings to myself. To be strong. To not let emotions show too much. 
So I learned how to hide things. I learned how to smile even when something inside me hurt. 
Music became my escape. Sad songs say the words I cannot bring myself to say out loud. 
They understand the parts of me that I don’t know how to explain.
</p>
<button onclick="flip(2)">Next</button>
</div>

<!-- Page 3 -->
<div class="page" id="p3" style="z-index:2;">
<h3>Page 3</h3>
<p>
Sometimes everything feels heavy because I try so hard to carry everyone else’s problems. 
I try to be the strong one. I try to be the listener. But I forget that I also need someone to understand me. 
I wish I knew how to open up without being afraid that once people see how deep my feelings are, 
they might slowly walk away.
</p>

<div class="page" id="p4" style="z-index:1;">
<h3>Page 4</h3>
<p>
If I ever make you mad, please tell me. If I ever make you sad, please tell me. 
I never want to hurt you without knowing it. I am still learning how to express myself in a healthy way. 
I am still learning that my feelings matter too. I don’t want to lose you, Angel. 
I just need patience while I learn how to lower my walls without feeling like I’ll be left alone again.
</p>
